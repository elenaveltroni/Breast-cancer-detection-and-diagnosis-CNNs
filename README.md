# Breast-cancer-detection-and-diagnosis-CNNs

This project aims to classify anomalies in mammography using convolutional neural
networks.
The dataset of interest is the CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital
Database for Screening Mammography) [1]: a digital breast imaging dataset
performed during screening mammography. The scale of the database along with
ground truth validation makes the DDSM a useful tool in the development and
testing of decision support systems.
The images have been decompressed and converted to DICOM format, the standard
format for the communication and management of medical imaging information
and related data.
The dataset is a collection of mammographic images containing 1458 cases of
calfications and 1218 cases of masses with verified pathology information by a
trained mammographer. Both can be benign or malignant, and the general task of
classification is to distinguish between two classes:
* Mass or calcification
* Malignant or benign.
